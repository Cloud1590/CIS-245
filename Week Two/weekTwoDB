When creating an If/else statement, it is important to remember the correct syntax in order to ensure the code runs as expected. 

1. An if/else statement always contains three components: 

The variable, the condition and the colon. 

Example:

if score >= 80:

2. The true statement must be indented underneath the "If" statement. Anything that comes back as false, python will move on to the next non-indented line. (including elif statements) 


Example continued:

if score >= 80:
    print("You passed!")
elif:
    print("You failed!")
