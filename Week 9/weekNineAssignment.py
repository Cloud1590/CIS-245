'''
Your program will then use the methods of the student class to accomplish the following:
Prompt the user for the first and last name of the student.
Create a student object by passing the first and last name to the __init__ method.
Create a loop that prompts the user for the following: The credits and grade for each course the student has taken.
Once the user ends the loop display the studentâ€™s cumulative GPA.


Create a student class that implements the following class diagram that will calculate and display student cumulative GPA: 

Student
Attributes:
First Name
Last Name
Grade Point
Credits
GPA
Methods:
__init__
CalculateGPA
GetGPA
